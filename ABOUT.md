Dyna-Burr is a finishing partner for high-volume OEM and component manufacturers, not a consumer-facing shop. Its primary industries are automotive, construction, marine, agriculture, electronics, and appliance, all centered around fasteners and small metal parts that need mechanical zinc or zinc-alloy coatings and related finishes.[1][2][4]

## Primary industries

- Automotive: High-hardness bolts, screws, and small components for engines, chassis, and assemblies where hydrogen embrittlement-free zinc, zinc-aluminum, or similar coatings are required to meet OEM specs like Ford, GM, Stellantis, and major Tier suppliers. Think fasteners, washers, and hardware that live in the underbody, engine bay, and structural areas.[5][1]

- Construction and infrastructure: Utility staples, structural screws, anchors, and other hardware used in framing, bridges, and outdoor structures that need thick, corrosion-resistant mechanical galvanizing that competes with hot-dip but looks cleaner.[4][1]

- Marine and outdoor power: Fasteners and components for boat builders, marine hardware makers, and outdoor power equipment (mowers, snowblowers, implements) where salt spray and weather are brutal and uniform zinc or zinc-aluminum coatings are required.[9][1][4]

- Agriculture: Hardware and fasteners used in tractors, implements, irrigation systems, and ag machinery that sit outside in moisture and chemicals, requiring adjustable coating thickness and strong corrosion performance at scale.[1][5]

- Electronics and appliance: Washers, contacts, small brackets, and connectors that need thin zinc, tin, or silver coatings for conductivity and appearance, often going into consumer appliances and industrial electronics.[4][5][1]

## Typical client profile

Dyna-Burr is built to serve OEMs, Tier 1/Tier 2 suppliers, and high mix/high volume component manufacturers who outsource finishing instead of building plating in house. Ideal clients fall into buckets like:[8][5]

- Fastener manufacturers: Cold headers, screw machine shops, and stampers supplying bolts, screws, nuts, staples, and washers that must ship with ASTM B695 and OEM-specific finishes already on them.[5][1][4]

- Metal stampers and machine shops: Producers of brackets, clips, small housings, and specialty hardware that require mechanical plating, galvanizing, chromate, and lubricated finishes as part of their PPAP or print package.[2][5]

- OEMs and big brands: Automotive, off-highway, agriculture, marine, appliance, and electronics brands whose specifications show up explicitly on Dyna-Burr’s capability list (Ford, GM, Caterpillar, John Deere, Mercury Marine, GE, etc.), usually serviced via their Tier suppliers rather than direct walk-in work.[5]

If you are sourcing for a Chicagoland or Midwest manufacturer, the practical takeaway is simple. Dyna-Burr is the mechanical plating / mechanical galvanizing house you bolt into your supply chain when you need high capacity, hydrogen embrittlement-free coatings on fasteners and small parts for automotive, construction, marine, ag, appliance, or electronics programs, with documentation against ASTM and OEM specs.[1][4][5]
