## README.txt

This repository provides open access to a growing library of documents and white papers developed by PlatingSRC, the marketing group for Dyna Burr Chicago Inc. We created this space so technical teams, buyers, engineers, and operations leaders can reach proven insights without friction. Everything here is free to view and download. The intent is to make reliable manufacturing knowledge easier to share and easier to apply.

The materials cover a range of topics tied to plating, finishing, and production performance. Some pieces speak to process control. Others examine industry trends or offer straightforward guidance for teams that want to tighten their workflow. The goal is clarity supported by experience. Each document reflects the same care we bring to our client work.
